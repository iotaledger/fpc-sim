## About

This repository is where the IOTA Foundation's Research Team simulates tests on the [Fast Probabilistic Consensus (FPC) protocol](https://coordicide.iota.org/module4.1.2) to study attack strategies on different kinds of network topologies.

By making this repository open source, the goal is to allow you to run your own simulations and get involved with development.

## Design

Fast Probabilistic Consensus (FPC) is one of the proposed consensus algorithms in [Coordicide](https://coordicide.iota.org/) (the removal of the IOTA Coordinator).

In FPC, nodes vote on whether they like or dislike a transaction. This vote is represented by a 1 or 0. When all honest nodes reach the same voting opinion, consensus is reached.

In the simulation, nodes can be either honest or adverse. Honest nodes query the opinion of a random set of other nodes (defined in a `k` parameter) and set their own opinion to the majority opinion.

To simulate an attack on the protocol, you can set a strategy for the adversary nodes in the `Adv_Strategy` parameter.

Nodes vote in rounds. You can define the average opinion of the honest nodes (defined in the `p0` parameter) for the initial round. For example, if `p0=0.9`, the honest nodes will have a 90% majority of 1 opinions when the simulation starts. As a result consensus should be reached on the value 1. If `p0=0.2`, the honest nodes will have an 80% majority of 0. As a result, consensus should be reached on the value 0. 

For a given round each node calculates the average opinion of `k` randomly queried nodes and this value is denoted as *eta*. If eta is larger than the threshold, the opinion of that node is set 1, or 0 otherwise. The threshold is between `[a,b]` in the first round, and between `[beta,1-beta]` in the following rounds. For a given node the protocol terminates if the node has the same opinion for `l` (but at least `l`+`m`) consecutive rounds. Unless the round is the last one (defined in `maxTermRound`), in which case the simulation stops with a termination failure.

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need to have at least [version 1.13 of Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed on your device.

To check if you have Go installed, run the following command:

```bash
go version
```

## Getting started

To get started, follow these steps to build and run the simulator.

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/fpc-sim.git
    ```

2. Build the executable file

    ```
    cd fpc-sim
    go build -o sim
    ```

    You can also use the `build` tool to cross-compile the binary files for other architectures.

3. If you're using Windows, add the `.exe` file extension to the `sim` file

4. Run the simulation

    ```
    ./sim
    ```

A progress bar displays the simulation's progress across the entire parameter space. When the progress bar reaches 100%, the simulator has finished for all parameter settings.

### Examining the data

To analyse the results of the simulation, read the `.csv` files in the `data` directory:

- **AgreementRate:** Rate at which all honest nodes conclude with the same opinion 
- **IntegrityRate:** Rate at which all honest nodes conclude with the same opinion and the final opinion is the same as the original majority
- **TerminationRate:** Rate at which all honest nodes conclude before maxTermRound
- **MeanTerminationRound:** Average round when FPC terminated
- **MedianTerminationRound:** Median round when FPC terminated
- **TerminationRound:** How many rounds are necessary to complete FPC (Histogram)
- **MeanLastRound:** Mean last round across all nodes
- **LastRoundHisto:** Histogram of nodes' individual termination rounds
- **OnesProportion:** The proportion of 1s after the protocol terminates
- **OnesPropEvolution:** Evolution of the 1s proportion
- **EtaEvolution:** Histogram of honest eta's for each round

Now that you have data, you can run one of the Python scripts to visualize the data in a graph.

### Visualizing the data

To generate graphs of the data, run the provided Python script.

You must have Python and PIP installed to run this script. The script generates graphs in `.eps` files, so to view the graphs, you also need an application that can open these files.

1. Install the dependencies

    ```bash
    pip install dash numpy matplotlib
    ```

2. For a single-vector-parameter input, edit the output setting in the `plot.py` file to read the correct csv column

    ```
    python plot.py
    ```
The script provides two figures:
- The termination, agreement, and integrity rate
- The mean last round for all nodes, as well as the mean round at which the protocol terminated

**Note:** The total message complexity in the network can be approximated by the mean last round times the quorum size k times the number of nodes.

3. For 2-vector-parameter inputs, edit the output setting in the ` file` to read your chosen csv columns

    ```
    python plot2D.py
    ```
The script provides plots with the termination, agreement, and integrity rate as a heat map of the input vectors. 

4. For a single-parameter input (no vector), enable the `enableSaveEta` parameter in the `input.txt` file and run:

    ```
    python plot_eps.py
    ```
In every round the number of non-finalized honest nodes are counted that have taken on a given eta value and the result is stored in a slice of histograms (`EtaEvolution`). This data is used to output a heatmap of the eta's evolution with time. 

### Parameters

These parameters affect how the simulated network behaves. As a result, changing these paramters has an affect on how long the network takes to reach a consensus.

A description and functionality of some of the parameters is provided in [the blog](https://blog.iota.org/the-fast-probabilistic-consensus-simulator-d5963c558b6e) that accompanies the release of this code.

To change any of these parameters, edit them in the `input.txt` file.

### Adversary's strategies

The simulator supports the following strategies:

- **Strategy 1:** cautious, always send the opposite of the initial majority, determined by `p0`
- **Strategy 2:** cautious, send the minority of the honest nodes of the previous round
- **Strategy 3:** berserk, adversary tries to delay the process by splitting the opinions
- **Strategy 4:** berserk, adversary tries to delay the process in maximizing the uncertainty
- **Strategy 5:** berserk, try to keep the median of the eta's close to 1/2
